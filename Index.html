        In the Mediterranean, ice cream appears to have been accessible to
        ordinary people by the mid-18th century. Ice cream became popular and
        inexpensive in England in the mid-nineteenth century, when Swiss émigré
        Carlo Gatti set up the first stand outside Charing Cross station in
        1851. He sold scoops in shells for one penny. Prior to this, ice cream
        was an expensive treat confined to those with access to an ice
        house.[40] Gatti built an 'ice well' to store ice that he cut from
        Regent's Canal under a contract with the Regent's Canal Company. By
        1860, he expanded the business and began importing ice on a large scale
        from Norway.
